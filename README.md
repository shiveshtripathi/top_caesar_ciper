# Caesar Cipher

This project implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm in Ruby, as part of [The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher).

## Features

- Encrypts a given string using a specified shift factor.
- Maintains original letter casing (e.g., 'A' shifts to 'B', 'a' shifts to 'b').
- Handles wrapping from 'Z' to 'A' (or 'z' to 'a').
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (numbers, punctuation, spaces) unchanged.
